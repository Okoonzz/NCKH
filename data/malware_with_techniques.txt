Tên malware: BPFDoor
Mã định danh: S1161
Mô tả: [BPFDoor](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1161) is a Linux based passive long-term backdoor used by China-based threat actors. First seen in 2021, [BPFDoor](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1161) is named after its usage of Berkley Packet Filter (BPF) to execute single task instructions. [BPFDoor](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1161) supports multiple protocols for communicating with a C2 including TCP, UDP, and ICMP and can start local or reverse shells that bypass firewalls using iptables.(Citation: Sandfly BPFDoor 2022)(Citation: Deep Instinct BPFDoor 2023)

Kỹ thuật sử dụng:
- T1070: Indicator Removal
  Use: [BPFDoor](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1161) clears the file location `/proc/<PID>/environ` removing all environment variables for the process.(Citation: Sandfly BPFDoor 2022) 
- T1480: Execution Guardrails
  Use: [BPFDoor](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1161) creates a zero byte PID file at `/var/run/haldrund.pid`. [BPFDoor](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1161) uses this file to determine if it is already running on a system to ensure only one instance is executing at a time.(Citation: Sandfly BPFDoor 2022) 
- T1036.004: Masquerade Task or Service
  Use: [BPFDoor](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1161) overwrites the `argv[0]` value used by the Linux `/proc` filesystem to determine the command line and command name to display for each process. [BPFDoor](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1161) selects a name from 10 hardcoded names that resemble Linux system daemons, such as; `/sbin/udevd -d`, `dbus-daemon --system`, `avahi-daemon: chroot helper`, `/sbin/auditd -n`, and `/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-journald`.(Citation: Sandfly BPFDoor 2022)

  Use: [BPFDoor](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1161) sets the `MYSQL_HISTFILE` and `HISTFILE` to `/dev/null` preventing the shell and MySQL from logging history in `/proc/<PID>/environ`.(Citation: Sandfly BPFDoor 2022) 
- T1205.002: Socket Filters
  Use: [BPFDoor](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1161) uses BPF bytecode to attach a filter to a network socket to view ICMP, UDP, or TCP packets coming through ports 22 (ssh), 80 (http), and 443 (https). When [BPFDoor](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1161)  finds a packet containing its “magic” bytes, it parses out two fields and forks itself. The parent process continues to monitor filtered traffic while the child process executes the instructions from the parsed fields.(Citation: Sandfly BPFDoor 2022)(Citation: Deep Instinct BPFDoor 2023)
- T1564.011: Ignore Process Interrupts
  Use: [BPFDoor](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1161) set's it's process to ignore the following signals; `SIGHUP`, `SIGINT`, `SIGQUIT`, `SIGPIPE`, `SIGCHLD`, `SIGTTIN`, and `SIGTTOU`.(Citation: Deep Instinct BPFDoor 2023)
- T1036.009: Break Process Trees
  Use: After initial execution, [BPFDoor](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1161) forks itself and runs the fork with the `--init` flag, which allows it to execute secondary clean up operations. The parent process terminates leaving the forked process to be inherited by the legitimate process init.(Citation: Sandfly BPFDoor 2022)
- T1070.004: File Deletion
  Use: After initial setup, [BPFDoor](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1161)'s original execution process deletes the dropped binary and exits.(Citation: Sandfly BPFDoor 2022) 
- T1562.004: Disable or Modify System Firewall
  Use: [BPFDoor](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1161) starts a shell on a high TCP port starting at 42391 up to 43391, then changes the local `iptables` rules to redirect all packets from the attacker to the shell port.(Citation: Sandfly BPFDoor 2022) 
- T1070.006: Timestomp
  Use: [BPFDoor](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1161) uses the `utimes()` function to change the executable's timestamp.(Citation: Sandfly BPFDoor 2022) 
- T1059.004: Unix Shell
  Use: [BPFDoor](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1161) can create a reverse shell and supports vt100 emulator formatting.(Citation: Sandfly BPFDoor 2022)
- T1027: Obfuscated Files or Information
  Use: [BPFDoor](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1161) can require a password to activate the backdoor and uses RC4 encryption or static library encryption `libtomcrypt`.(Citation: Sandfly BPFDoor 2022)
